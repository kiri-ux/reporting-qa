Build identity.

Shown in the footer of every page and returned by /healthz, so you can confirm
which code is actually live before you trust what the screen says. Deploying
and then reading a stale container is easy to do and hard to spot - the
dashboard looks perfectly plausible either way.

BUMP `BUILD` on every deploy whose effect you need to confirm visually.
